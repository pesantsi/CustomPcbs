HWB pin: 1k or 10k? -> HWB resistor: 1k or 10k is fine, it's a pull down. I usually use 10k for this but 1k will work. dont go any smaller than that
USB Molex : Shield pin? -> shield pin: 0R resistor between it and GND to provide a star ground so ESD discharge will pass back thru the shield/cable

calculate cap values manually: https://community.nxp.com/t5/LPC-FAQs/How-to-calculate-the-value-of-crystal-load-capacitors/m-p/464589

you may want to use an mcp1700 or any other available ldo that uses smaller caps
just for ease of assembly/routing

he pin of the mcu (at90usb) has stray capacitance
and it also has internal capacitance from the pin to the crystal circuitry inside
and if I recall correctly, I read in the datasheet, that these 2 values summed together are around 3 pF
that's excluding the capacitance of your trace and pads, but you can assume that it's anywhere from 0pF to 4 pF I'd say
